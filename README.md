# tiny-crm :date: :email: :tada:

A series of Google App Scripts designed to automate prospect and lead management.

## Features

Currently, the feature set is relatively simple but I'm open to suggestions/ideas for further expansion (initially within the scope of the spreadsheet itself).

Two functions provide logic to move contacts around based on their status (which would be a column with dropdown fields in each cell) and are called when a change is made (the "change" trigger for the Google Sheet). Another two functions look through the active/signup tabs and identify contacts who should be updated on the status of the given project (this is based on a period of time and the access status set per each contact).

PRs are more than welcome! I'll add to the roadmap and documentation as I go along (it definitely needs expansion).
